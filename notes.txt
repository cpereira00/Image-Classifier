ML pipeline
1. define the task
2. get the dataset
3. create ML model
4. train your ML model
5. Deploy your trained model
6. test your deployed model (got back to step 2 if not good)

Task: create a web app that lets you upload the images and detect the main ingredient in the dish

using CNNs , transfer learning

GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE
initially:
                    read
data on local disk -----> train on local machine

using cloud:
                     Download then read
data on google bucket --------------> train on local machine         (need credentials to access bucket)

or more optimally:
                     Download then read
data on google bucket --------------> train on google cloud AI-platform

DOCKER
- allows to group application and its dependencies inside a virtual setup called a docker image
- allows to isolate this setup from you system
- allows to run 1+ copies of application called docker containers

same thing will happen as before except now its in a docker container
so I built a docker image and ran a docker container
So once we have a docker image that can run the training for us, we only need to push it to
the cloud and run the image.


CLOUD COMPUTING (GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM)
- Cloud computing is the on demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power,
w/o direct active management by the user.
- like remote linux machines

Ill be using google AI-platform
- GCP service for AI tasks
- has different approaches to training machine learning models (direct or through containers)
- supports most ML frameworks

HYPERPARAMETER TUNING
- some params are learned, others are tuned ie learning rate, # epochs, batch size
